            I'm hurtin', baby, I'm broken down
            I need your lovin', lovin', I need it now
            When I'm without you, I'm somethin' weak
            You got me beggin', beggin', I'm on my knees, yeah (hey)

            I don't wanna be needing your love (hey)
            I just wanna be deep in your love (hey)
            And it's killin' me when you're away, ooh, baby (hey)
            'Cause I really don't care where you are (hey)
            I just wanna be there where you are (hey)
            And I gotta get one little taste

            Your sugar, yes, please
            Won't you come and put it down on me?
            I'm right here 'cause I need
            Little love and little sympathy
            Yeah, you show me good lovin', make it alright
            Need a little sweetness in my life
            Your sugar, yes, please
            Won't you come and put it down on me? (Ayy, uh, uh)

            My broken pieces, you pick 'em up
            Don't leave me hangin', hangin', come give me some
            When I'm without you, I'm so insecure
            You are the one thing, one thing I'm living for (hey)

            I don't wanna be needing your love (hey)
            I just wanna be deep in your love (hey)
            And it's killin' me when you're away, ooh, baby (hey)
            'Cause I really don't care where you are (hey)
            I just wanna be there where you are
            And I gotta get one little taste

            Your sugar, yes, please
            Won't you come and put it down on me?
            I'm right here 'cause I need
            Little love and little sympathy
            Yeah, you show me good lovin', make it alright
            Need a little sweetness in my life
            Your sugar (your sugar), yes, please (yes, please)
            Won't you come and put it down on me? Yeah

            I want that red velvet, I want that sugar sweet
            Don't let nobody touch it, unless that somebody's me
            I gotta be a man, there ain't no other way
            'Cause girl, you're hotter than a Southern California day
            I don't wanna play no games
            You don't gotta be afraid
            Don't give me all that shy sh-
            No makeup on, that's my

            Sugar, yes, please (please)
            Won't you come and put it down on me? (Down on me)
            I'm right here (I'm right here) 'cause I need ('cause I need)
            Little love and little sympathy
            So baby (yeah), you show me good lovin', make it alright
            Need a little sweetness in my life (yeah, yeah, hey)
            Your sugar (sugar), yes, please (yes, please)
